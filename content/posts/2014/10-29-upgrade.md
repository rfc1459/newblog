As you may have noticed, I performed a bit of sorely needed housekeeping.

First of all, I dropped the rotting versions of Bootstrap and Font-Awesome I
was pulling as git submodules and now I'm pulling them from MaxCDN as
everybody else and their neighbor.

The upgrade was not easy and to permanently mark the feat I forced a
merge-commit of the branch where I performed the hard work. There are still
some rough edges, but it's pretty much what I want &mdash; an _ugly_ website
:-)

Second, I dropped some blogs from the blogroll who were well on the way to
bitrot. Sadly, among them was Groklaw: I miss PJ's hard work, but I understand
why she did that.

Last but not least, I dropped some heavily politically-loaded posts which
should have never been here in the first place. I know that anything is hardly
"gone forever" with Google crawling the hell out of every website, but frankly
I prefer to disavow those posts here and now because they were pointless
rants.

Feel free to pull them from a public cache if you really want to, but don't
come here flaming me because of those: I'll just throw your flame down
/dev/null.

So, what's going to happen to this blog? Well, I have quite a few things to
write about, I've been mostly active on Twitter and I came to realize that
it's a **terrible** medium to fully express complex ideas. There are things I
want to discuss with the very few readers I have and some useful things I came
across during my journey as sysadmin that I want to share.

Hence, back to the roots. :-)
