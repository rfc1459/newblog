So, you just bought a Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition with Ubuntu 12.04
pre-installed and you expect it to work flawlessly out-of-the-box, right?

**WRONG**.

As much as I like this machine, its chipmaker (hello, Intel: I hate you.)
decided to make life miserable for us in a number of ways:

* the Centrino Advanced-N 6235 firmware stalls in an unrecoverable way
* the EHCI and XHCI controllers prevent successful hibernation
* the Centrino display backlight control confuses gnome-settings-daemon, so
  brightness settings won't survive across reboots

Sounds you should stay away from a machine like that, huh? Well, let's just
say that I fought the beast (and won) so you won't have to :-)

<!-- break -->

Let's start from the ugliest thing: the dreaded Advanced-N lockup.

When you first start up the machine and try to update to the latest 12.04
point release, you'll find that the update will stall while downloading
the hefty amount of packages, followed by the wlan losing the association
with the access point.

This is a [known issue][centrino] with iwlwifi which hasn't been dealt with
by Intel or the upstream developers for quite a while. The usual workarounds
like disabling 802.11n and switching to software crypto for some reason don't
work on the XPS 13, leaving the average user one option only: a reboot.

Now, that sounds like windows, does it? Luckily, the XPS 13 has support for
PCI hotplug, so I tried to reinitialise the card as soon as it stalled by
poking sysfs. Needless to say, it sprang back to life immediately and *it didn't
lock itself up anymore*.

Armed with that knowledge, I made the following modifications to `/etc/rc.local`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.
 
echo 1 > "/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/remove" || true
echo 1 > "/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:1c.0/rescan" || true
 
exit 0
```

Those commands essentially shut down the card during boot and then re-enable it
afterwards through a bus rescan. I honestly don't know why it works, but it does.

In order to find the right device/slot addresses, lspci is your friend:

```
$ lspci -tv
-[0000:00]-+-00.0  Intel Corporation Ivy Bridge DRAM Controller
           +-02.0  Intel Corporation Ivy Bridge Graphics Controller
           +-14.0  Intel Corporation Panther Point USB xHCI Host Controller
           +-16.0  Intel Corporation Panther Point MEI Controller #1
           +-1a.0  Intel Corporation Panther Point USB Enhanced Host Controller #2
           +-1b.0  Intel Corporation Panther Point High Definition Audio Controller
           +-1c.0-[01]----00.0  Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6235
           +-1d.0  Intel Corporation Panther Point USB Enhanced Host Controller #1
           +-1f.0  Intel Corporation Panther Point LPC Controller
           +-1f.2  Intel Corporation Panther Point 6 port SATA Controller [AHCI mode]
           \-1f.3  Intel Corporation Panther Point SMBus Controller
```

One more thing before moving on: you'll also have to disable power saving for the
card by creating `/etc/pm.d/power.d/wireless` with the following contents:

    /sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off

This has a significant impact on battery duration, but apparently power management
messes up with the firmware in unpredictable ways.

With the wlan out of the way, we still have non-functional hibernation. This is
caused both by some OEM setup leftovers and the aforementioned issues with EHCI
and XHCI.

As for the leftovers, you just have to issue two commands followed by a reboot:

    sudo apt-get --purge autoremove casper
    sudo update-initramfs -k all -u

This will disable zram functionality, which prevents the system from writing the
hibernation image on the swap partition.

Even so, the system would still lock up during resume because there are some
issues with the USB controllers.

There is a script floating around Arch and Ubuntu forums which causes pm-hibernate
to forcibly unbind all drivers from USB peripherals during hibernation and rebinds
them during resume. This should go into a file named
`/etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom-ehci_hcd` and marked executable with the usual
`chmod 755`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

unbindDev() {
  echo -n > $DEV_LIST 2>/dev/null
  for driver in $DRIVERS; do
    DDIR=$DRIVERS_DIR/${driver}_hcd
    for dev in `ls $DDIR 2>/dev/null | egrep "^$HEX+:$HEX+:$HEX"`; do
      echo -n "$dev" > $DDIR/unbind
      echo "$driver $dev" >> $DEV_LIST
    done
    echo -n > $DDIR/unbind
  done
}

bindDev() {
  if [ -s $DEV_LIST ]; then
    while read driver dev; do
      DDIR=$DRIVERS_DIR/${driver}_hcd
      echo -n > $DDIR/bind
      while [ $((MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS)) -gt 0 ]; do
        echo -n "$dev" > $DDIR/bind
        if [ ! -L "$DDIR/$dev" ]; then
          sleep $BIND_WAIT
        else
          break
        fi
        MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS=$((MAX_BIND_ATTEMPTS-1))
      done
    done < $DEV_LIST
  fi
  rm $DEV_LIST 2>/dev/null
  chvt 1
  chvt 7
}

case "$1" in
    hibernate)
      unbindDev;;
    thaw)
      bindDev;;
esac
```

After doing all this mumbo-jumbo hibernation works as expected, so you might
want to [enable hybrid suspend][hybrid] to improve battery duration.

The only thing left is making gnome-settings-daemon remember your current
brightness.

And this is where I have some real bad news: there is no solution. Granted,
there are a few workarounds involving gsd-backlight-helper, but they suck so
much that I won't detail them here. Google them if you really want to.

Same deal for the two-finger middle click: no sane settings, only some ugly
workarounds with synclient.

I hope this post helped you. Enjoy your system now :-)
